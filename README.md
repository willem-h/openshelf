Share books with friends.

## Contributing

We want to spend more time building cool stuff and less time configuring
things. Use this as a starter template for your next Ruby project, ie.
when you're not using Rails.

To setup your local environment use:

```
bin/setup
```

Then to access the [local Openshelf](http://localhost:3000/) at:

`bin/go`

I'm always open to pull requests.
